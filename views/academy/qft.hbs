                        <p>
                            The Question Formulation Technique (QFT) is a simple step-by-step, rigorous process
                            that facilitates the asking of many questions. The process includes the following steps:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>A Question Focus (QFocus)</li>

                        </ol>
                        <h5>The Question Focus</h5>
                        <p>A stimulus; a springboard you will use to ask
                            questions. The QFocus can be a topic, image, phrase or situation that will serve as the
                            “focus” for generating questions. An effective QFocus should be clear, should provoke
                            and stimulate new lines of thinking and should not be a question.</p>

                                    of technology with elements of problem-based learning, flipping the classroom and making
                                    students the leaders of their learning experience. While other pedagogies produce similar
                                    results, none can match the simplicity of implementation and organic spread.

"The key is having the right question," she said. "You don't want it to be too easy so students can find the answer right away, but you also don't want it so difficult that they get discouraged. But I can see how this process can be incredibly successful with all levels of students."</blockquote>

Which they did. Lots of them. He suggests that there are two reasons why it’s being so widely used: it’s so easy to implement and it’s incredibly engaging for students, and he speaks with evident pride about the way that he has seen regular SOLE use beginning to change the learning identity of students from passive consumers to learners who are actively creating their own opportunities.</blockquote>
