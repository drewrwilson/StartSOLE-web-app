                            <option><p>Nice work! It's not uncommon to provide students with some resources to help them get started with the research phase, and if you'd like to see some materials compiled by other teachers, check out what's available at <a href="https://app.startsole.org/#!/resources">https://app.startsole.org/#!/resources</a>.  We also just added a new Sample Presentation Rubric to help with student presentations.  It's aligned to Common Core standards and might be of interest to you in future SOLEs.</p></option>
                            <option><p>Glad to hear students were able to discover the meaning of hierarchy on their own.  If you'd like support with student communication during the presentation phase, we just added a new Sample Presentation Rubric to help with student presentations.  It's aligned to Common Core standards and might be of interest to you in future SOLEs; you can find it at <a href="https://app.startsole.org/#!/resources">https://app.startsole.org/#!/resources</a></p></option>
                            <option><p>This looks like a good SOLE, and your observations show deep reflection on the process.  Our resources section has a student organizer called 'Research Notes' submitted by another teacher which is designed to help students get better at paraphrasing.  Feel free to check it out by visiting <a href="https://app.startsole.org/#!/resources">https://app.startsole.org/#!/resources</a> and searching for 'Research Notes'.</p> <p>I also noticed that you were displaying a timer on your projector during the student presentations.  The new StartSOLE app allows you to wirelessly connect to your projector and display class timers, your big question, rubrics, and ground rules for students.  If you'd like to try it out, visit <a href="http://www.startsole.org/app-home.html">http://www.startsole.org/app-home.html</a> to get started.</p> <p>Keep up the great work!</p></option>

                            <option><p>In the future, please include photos in your reflection... this is a great question and we'd love to see the work your students produced!</p></option>
                            <option><p>Nice work!</p></option>
                            <option><p>This also looks like a great SOLE session!  Could you tell me a little more about how you used modeling boards for this SOLE?  This may be a technique that we'd like to share with other teachers if it worked well for your class.</p></option>

                            <option><p>Don't give up!  It's not unusual that the first SOLE experience is challenging, our research has shown that it takes about 3 SOLE sessions for deeper transformation to take root.  If there are particular ideas that came out of your discussion about what you'd try differently next time we'd love to hear them... we're always trying to spread best practices through the SOLE community.</p></option>
